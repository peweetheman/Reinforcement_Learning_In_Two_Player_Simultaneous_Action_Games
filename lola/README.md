Learning with Opponent-Learning Awareness
=========================================

Implements the LOLA ([AAMAS'18](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04326)) and LOLA-DiCE ([ICML'18](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05098)) algorithms.


**Further resources:**
- A pytorch implementation of LOLA-DiCE is available at https://github.com/alexis-jacq/LOLA_DiCE.
- A colab notebook with the nummerical evalution for DiCE is available at https://goo.gl/xkkGxN.

## Installation

To run the code, you need to pip-install it as follows:

```bash
$ pip install -e .
```

After installation, you can run different experiments using the run scripts provided in `scripts/`.
Use `run_lola.lola.py` and `run_tournament.py` for running experiments from the [AAMAS'18 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04326).
Use `run_lola_dice.py` for reproducing experiments from the [ICML'18 paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.05098).
Check out `notebooks/` for IPython notebooks with plots.

**Note:** this code is not tested on GPU, so there might be unexpected issues.

*Disclaimer:* This is a research code release that has not been tested beyond the use cases and experiments discussed in the original papers.

## Contribution

Contributions to further enhance and improve the code are welcome.
